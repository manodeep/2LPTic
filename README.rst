Description
===========

This repo contains 2LPT IC generation code from Roman Scoccimarro. 
Original code can be found `here <http://cosmo.nyu.edu/roman/2LPT/>`__

The code has been updated with lots of checks about INT overflow and 
64 bit IDs. Dependency on Numerical Recipes in C has been replaced 
with ``gsl``. This code can accept P(k) generated by 
`CAMB <http://camb.info/>`__.

Installation
============

Pre-requisites
--------------

1. An MPI capable compiler ``mpicc``
2. Double precision MPI FFTW2 libraries (``fftw2.1.5``)
3. ``gsl`` library

Compilation
-----------

1. Setup the ``Makefile`` options according to the simulation IC. 
Default options are matched to running a single-species 
dark matter only cosmological simulation. 
2. Check the paths to ``MPI``, ``FFTW`` and ``GSL`` libraries.
3. Typing ``make`` should generate the executable. 

Generating Consistent Particle IDs
----------------------------------

If you are running convergence tests, then the particle IDs for
the lower resolution simulation can be sampled from the particle IDs
of the highest resolution simulation you want to compare to. For instance,
if you want to run a ``1024^3`` simulation with particle IDs matched to
a ``2048^3`` simulation, then set ``Nmesh=2048``, ``Nsample=1024`` and
``GlassTileFacSample=2``. The generated IDs will not be contiguous 
anymore but the particle in the same spatial location should get 
an identical ID as the particle in the hi-res simulation. Since the particle
ID is essentially set by the hi-res simulation, the low-res simulation 
might require 64bit IDs just to store consistent IDs. The code will check
at runtime if the generated particle IDs are too large to fit into 32bit
integers (only relevant when ``USE_64BITID`` Makefile option is not 
set during compilation).

Running 
=======

1. Edit the parameter file. See example parameter file provided in
`example.params <example.params>`__
2. Launch the MPI process ``mpirun -np Ncpus ./2LPTic simulation.param``
(refer to your computing cluster documentation for submitting and 
running jobs)


Author
======

Author is Roman Scoccimarro (I think based on N-GenIC developed by
Volker Springel). Current repo contains contribution from 
`Greg Poole <https://github.com/gbpoole/>`__ for the CAMB P(k)
handling and consistent particle IDs generation.

are probably my fault.
